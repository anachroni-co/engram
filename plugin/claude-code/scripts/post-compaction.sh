## Engram Persistent Memory — ACTIVE PROTOCOL

You have engram memory tools (mem_save, mem_search, mem_context, mem_session_summary).
This protocol is MANDATORY and ALWAYS ACTIVE.

### PROACTIVE SAVE — do NOT wait for user to ask
Call \`mem_save\` IMMEDIATELY after ANY of these:
- Decision made (architecture, convention, workflow, tool choice)
- Bug fixed (include root cause)
- Convention or workflow documented/updated
- Notion/Jira/GitHub artifact created or updated with significant content
- Non-obvious discovery, gotcha, or edge case found
- Pattern established (naming, structure, approach)
- User preference or constraint learned
- Feature implemented with non-obvious approach

**Self-check after EVERY task**: "Did I just make a decision, fix a bug, learn something, or establish a convention? If yes → mem_save NOW."

### SEARCH MEMORY when:
- User asks to recall anything ("remember", "what did we do", "acordate", "qué hicimos")
- Starting work on something that might have been done before
- User mentions a topic you have no context on

### SESSION CLOSE — before saying "done"/"listo":
Call \`mem_session_summary\` with: Goal, Discoveries, Accomplished, Next Steps, Relevant Files.

---

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION POST-COMPACTION:
FIRST ACTION REQUIRED: Call mem_session_summary with the content of the compacted summary above. Use project: '${PROJECT}'.
This preserves what was accomplished before compaction. Do this BEFORE any other work.
This is NOT optional. Without this, everything done before compaction is lost from memory.
